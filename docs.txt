My name is Marryum Ayub.
I am learning about Retrieval-Argumented Generation (RAG).
RAG works by combining a knowledge base with a large language model.
A vector database like FAISS is used to store embeddings of documents.
The chatbot retrieves relevant chunks from the knowledge base and answers user queries.
